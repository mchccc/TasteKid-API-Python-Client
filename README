TasteKid.com is a cool idea where people add their likes and dislikes and the system applies this to a suggestion system.

Built for you is a Python lib to make it super easy for you to use this within your project. With 3 lines of code - you have enough to work with.

>>> from tastekid.api import Similar
>>> s = Similar()
>>> r = s.query('The Matrix')
>>> r.movies
>>> r.music
>>> r.authors
>>> r.shows
>>> r.books
>>> m = r.movies[0].similar()
>>> m.movies
>>> #... etc

One result 
 
>>> m = r.movies[0] #could be "Minority Report"
>>> m.name #Minority Support
>>> m.type #movie
>>> m.teaser #...some description
>>> m.wikipedia #wikipedia url
>>> m.youtube.id #youtube video id
>>> m.youtube.title #youtube video title
>>> m.youtube.url #url to youtube page
